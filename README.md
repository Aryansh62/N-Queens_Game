# N-Queens Problem â€“ Tkinter GUI Game ðŸŽ¯â™•  

A Python GUI-based interactive implementation of the classic **N-Queens Problem** using `Tkinter`. Users can play the game by placing queens on a customizable `NxN` chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.  

## ðŸ§  About the N-Queens Problem  
The goal of the N-Queens problem is to place N queens on an `NÃ—N` chessboard so that no two queens attack each other â€” meaning no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

## ðŸ›  Features  
- Interactive GUI with a grid created using Tkinter
- Image-based queens loaded using Pillow (PIL)
- Visual validation of valid/invalid moves
- Dynamic board size (minimum 4Ã—4)
- Win/lose feedback with message boxes
- Fun and educational for learning recursion, constraints, and GUI design

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nqueens-tkinter.git
    cd nqueens-tkinter
    ```

2. Make sure you have Python installed (version â‰¥ 3.6)

3. Install required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install Pillow
    ```

4. Update the image path in the code:
    > Replace  
    ```python
    img[nq] = Image.open("E:/python 1/bq.png")
    ```  
    with the actual path to your queen image (`bq.png`)

- Python 3
- Tkinter â€“ GUI library
- Pillow (PIL) â€“ for handling image resizing
- Math â€“ to handle diagonal constraints
